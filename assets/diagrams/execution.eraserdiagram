title High-Level System Architecture: Reasoning vs Execution Separation

// Left Side: Agent Layer
ROA Agent [icon: user, color: blue, label: "ROA Agent"] {
  LLM Reasoning [icon: brain, label: "LLM Reasoning"]
  Memory History [icon: book, label: "Memory/History"]
}

// Policy Proposal document (output from Agent)
Policy Proposal [icon: file-text, label: "Policy Proposal"]

// Center: Barrier (represented as a group for visual separation)

// Right Side: Runtime Layer (Deterministic)
Runtime Layer [icon: server, color: green, label: "Runtime Layer"] {
  DIM [icon: shield, label: "DIM (Validation & Safety)"]
  Execution Engine [icon: play, label: "Execution Engine (API Calls / Market Orders)"]
  Context Store [icon: database, label: "Context Store"]
}

// Connections (left-to-right flow, then feedback loop)
LLM Reasoning > Policy Proposal: propose policy
Policy Proposal > DIM: cross barrier
DIM > Execution Engine: validate & forward
Execution Engine > Context Store: update context
Memory History < Context Store: feedback loop
